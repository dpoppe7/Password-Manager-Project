# Project Manager App

App Description:
A basic password management app that allows users to store username, password, and what account those values are for.
The user's data is protected by a pin that they set, but there is an option to externally reset all of the information
in the app should the user forget their pin. 
The app also implements the Have I Been Pwned API to check whether the user's password has been involved in a breach.
